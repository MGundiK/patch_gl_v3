    GLPatch v5 dual-stream network.
    
    Two targeted improvements over xPatch:
    
    1. PRE-POINTWISE INTER-PATCH GATING (from v2, our best module)
       - Conservative alpha=0.05 to stay close to xPatch baseline
       - Learns which temporal patches carry more predictive information
       - Demonstrated wins at long horizons across v2/v3/v4
    
    2. ADAPTIVE STREAM FUSION (new in v5)
       - xPatch uses fixed `cat → Linear` to combine seasonal + trend streams
       - This learns a STATIC weight per output timestep during training
       - v5 adds an input-dependent gate: for each sample, dynamically
         weights how much seasonality vs trend matters
       - Some inputs are trend-dominated (gate → 0), others are
         seasonality-dominated (gate → 1)
       - Implemented as: gate = σ(Ws·s + Wt·t), out = gate⊙s + (1-gate)⊙t
       - Then the existing fc8 refines the combined output
    
    v5 changes vs v4:
    - REMOVED dual gating (caused instability on ETTh1-720)
    - SINGLE pre-pointwise gate with conservative alpha=0.05
    - ADDED adaptive stream fusion (new mechanism, different weakness targeted)
